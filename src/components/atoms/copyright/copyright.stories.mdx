## Introduction

A Copyright component is usually used in the website's footer to display the copyright.

<CodePreview
  code={`import Copyright from "./components/atoms/copyright/copyright.astro"`}
  label="How to import"
  lang="ts"
/>
<CodePreview
  code={`<Copyright creationYear={2025} owner="John Doe" />`}
  label="Basic use"
  lang="astro"
>
  <Copyright creationYear={2025} owner="John Doe" />
</CodePreview>

## Different current and creation years

When the creation year is different from the current one, both years will be displayed.

<CodePreview
  code={`<Copyright creationYear={2020} owner="John Doe" />`}
  label="Automatic handling of dates"
  lang="astro"
>
  <Copyright creationYear={2020} owner="John Doe" />
</CodePreview>
