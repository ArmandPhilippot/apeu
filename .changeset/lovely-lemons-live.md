Adds independent theme mode support for code blocks.

A new setting is available in the website header and in each code block to update the theme used for code blocks. This allows users to use a light theme for the website and a dark theme for the code blocks, and conversely. It is also possible to infer the code block theme from the website theme when set to `Auto`.
