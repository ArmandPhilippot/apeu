Reverts ids generation of collection entries to Astro default behavior.

The routing logic changes has introduced a breaking change regarding generated ids. Previously, some ids were rewritten to be able to use shorter references in the frontmatter. The references ids now use the default format generated by Astro.

If you were relying on references (`category`, `tags` or `i18n`) in your content files, you'll need to update them to use the "full path" instead of the shorten one:
