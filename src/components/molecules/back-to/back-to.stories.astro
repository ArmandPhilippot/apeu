  <p>
    A BackTo component is special. It is used to navigate through a page using
    anchors. His purpose is to let the user go back to a previous anchor.

    <strong>Note:</strong> The button is currently designed to be used a "back to
    top" button but I choose to name it BackTo to support possible future variants.
