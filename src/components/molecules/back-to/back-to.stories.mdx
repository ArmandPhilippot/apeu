title: "BackTo"

import { components as mdxComponents } from "../../mdx";
import BackTo from "./back-to.astro";

export const components = mdxComponents;

## Usage

A BackTo component is special. It is used to navigate through a page using anchors. His purpose is to let the user go back to a previous anchor.

**Note:** The button is currently designed to be used a "back to top" button but I choose to name it BackTo to support possible future variants.

<BackTo anchor="#some-anchor" label="Back to some anchor" />
