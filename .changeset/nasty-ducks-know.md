Improves the differentiation of RSS items by prefixing their title with the content type.

Since I have some collections that target external resources (e.g. "John Doe" being in the blog roll), it might be confusing for someone subscribed to the RSS feed to see only "John Doe". By prefixing the title with the content type (e.g. "[Blogroll] John Doe"), it should prevent any confusion.
