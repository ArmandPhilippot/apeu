import { components as mdxComponents } from "../../mdx";
import Copyright from "./copyright.astro";

export const components = mdxComponents;

## Usage

This component is usually used in the website's footer to display the copyright.

<Copyright
  creationYear={new Date().getFullYear()}
  owner="John Doe"
/>

When the <code>creationYear</code> is different from the current year, then the output will look like this:

<Copyright creationYear={2010} owner="John Doe" />
