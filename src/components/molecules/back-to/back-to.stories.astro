    <p>
      A BackTo component is special. It is used to navigate through a page using
      anchors. His purpose is to let the user go back to a previous anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The button is currently designed to be used a "back
      to top" button but I choose to name it BackTo to support possible future variants.
    </p>
    <BackToComponent anchor="#some-anchor" label="Back to some anchor" />
