## Introduction

A BackTo component is special. It is used to navigate through a page using anchors. His purpose is to let the user go back to a previous anchor.

<CodePreview
  code={`import BackTo from "./components/molecules/back-to/back-to.astro";`}
  label="How to import"
  lang="ts"
/>

<CodePreview
  code={`<BackTo anchor="#some-anchor" label="Back to some anchor" />`}
  label="Basic use"
  lang="astro"
>
  <BackTo anchor="#some-anchor" label="Back to some anchor" />
</CodePreview>

**Note:** The button is currently designed to be used a "back to top" button but I choose to name it BackTo to support possible future variants.
